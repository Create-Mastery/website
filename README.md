## CLI

The Create Mastery website has a CLI (still WIP) that you can use for developing the website

For making the CLI runnable just run these commands:

```sh
npm install -g tsx # you need to have tsx installed globally for using the CLI
npm link # this creates the executable that you can run

cm version # now you can run the CLI!
```
